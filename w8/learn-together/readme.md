## About
For this week's learn together, I decided to create a program that logs your sleep, and then tells you some stats once you are done making entries. While this seems simple enough, working with the datetime module is pretty difficult, so that caused a lot of issues.

## Notes
- **Time format:** To prevent errors, enter times in an hh:mm format. For example, enter 07:30 instead of 7:30.
- **Date Format:** To prevent errors, enter dates in a mm/dd/yyyy format. For example, enter 02/22/2022 instead of 2/22/22.
- **Sleep Schedules:** Please note that the program assumes you are entereing a time after noon when you start sleep, and a time in the morning when you awake. If your sleep schedule does not fit within these parameters, I suggest you make some changes to your daily habits ;)
